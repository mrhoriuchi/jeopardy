# Jeopardy!
Jeopardy is a quiz show that has a unique answer-and-question format in which contestants are presented with clues in the form of answers and must phrase their responses in the form of a question. Enjoy your own game of Jeopardy from this project that I created using jService API!

### How to play:
- Click on the "Start" button to create the board
- Click on a box with a money value to reveal the clue
- Click again on the box with the clue to reveal the answer
- Clicking the "Restart" button will restart the game with a new set of categories
